# üìä Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Analytics project repository! This project focuses on uncovering insights from raw data using both **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Analytics** techniques.

## üîç Overview

The goal of this project is to walk through a complete data analysis lifecycle ‚Äî from basic exploration to advanced insights ‚Äî using tools like SQL and visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, etc.).

## üß™ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps understand the structure, patterns, and initial signals in a dataset. This stage includes:

1. **Database Exploration**  
   Identify available tables, columns, and their relationships.

2. **Dimensions Exploration**  
   Analyze non-numeric (categorical) fields like category, product type, location.

3. **Date Exploration**  
   Time-based trends: yearly, monthly, or daily activity.

4. **Measures Exploration**  
   Inspect large numerical variables (sales, cost, profit).

5. **Magnitude Analysis**  
   Determine the size or contribution of each category.

6. **Ranking (Top N / Bottom N)**  
   Rank top-performing entities such as products, customers, or locations.

## üìà Advanced Analytics

This stage goes deeper into the "why" behind the trends identified in EDA:

7. **Change-Over-Time (Trends)**  
   Track how metrics evolve across time.

8. **Cumulative Analysis**  
   Understand running totals and progressive growth.

9. **Performance Analysis**  
   Compare actual results vs. targets or historical performance.

10. **Part-to-Whole (Proportional)**  
   Analyze how individual segments contribute to the whole (e.g., pie charts).

11. **Data Segmentation**  
   Group data by demographics, categories, or behavior to find unique patterns.

12. **Reporting**  
   Build clean and actionable dashboards or reports for decision-makers.
